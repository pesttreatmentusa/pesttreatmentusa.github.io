Socio-psychological aspects consisting of ethical and rational factors to consider were discovered to the chauffeurs in IPM application in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A study of veggie growers in Sri Lanka revealed that nearly 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications before pest or illness occurrence and only 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A study conducted by Parsa et al. (2014) also revealed that an absence of certified IPM experts and extension educators was an obstacle for IPM execution in industrialized nations.</p>
<p>In reference to the idea of incorporating making use of biological and other controls in complementary ways, the term was later on broadened to accept coordinated usage of all biological, cultural, and synthetic practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962).
