<p>Bed bugs, insects and infected food do not come as a surprise from the health sector. Boron, a recognized pesticide can be impregnated into the paper fibers of cellulose insulation at particular levels to attain a mechanical kill element for self-grooming insects such as ants, cockroaches, termites, and more. A reliable monitoring program will determine what pests exist and how they are getting in the facility, and will provide insight for the development of a preventive program targeted at chosen pest problems.</p>
<p>A method that involves using pest-tolerant and pest-resistant cultivars established through traditional breeding or genetic modification (Douglas 2018, Kennedy 2008, Nelson et al. 2018 ). These cultivars possess physical, morphological, or biochemical characters that reduce the plant's beauty or viability for the pest to feed, establish, or reproduce effectively.</p>
<p>Screens, drifting row covers, or food containers with tight-fitting covers which function as barriers to pests.
