Numerous anti-pesticide NGOs have a far more simplified definition of IPM - they see IPM as being almost exclusively about lowering pesticide use.

Other claims consist of decreases in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into a number of crops to minimize the need for other, less environmentally favorable, herbicides.</p>
