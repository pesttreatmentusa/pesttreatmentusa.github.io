<h3>Hire Pest Control Companies Athens GA</h3>
<p>Although several sources define IPM in different ways, previous models mostly focused on the environmental, and to some level on the evolutionary, aspects of pest management (Peterson et al. 2018 ). A recent IPM pyramid presented by Stenberg (2017) identified a lack of a holistic IPM method that uses both modern and standard tools.</p>
<p>If you ever see pests returning after treatment, Stay alert and call your pest control expert for a follow-up treatment. Modern crop varieties frequently accidentally produce conditions which favor pest types (e.g., pest types which have actually bored deeper into bigger fruit making them unattainable to natural opponents).
