<h3>Chemical Pest Control Overview Center Line MI</h3>
<p>With IPM you'll use the most selective pesticide that will get the job done and be the safest for other organisms and for water, soil, and air quality; use pesticides in bait stations rather than sprays; or spot-spray a couple of weeds rather of a whole area.
