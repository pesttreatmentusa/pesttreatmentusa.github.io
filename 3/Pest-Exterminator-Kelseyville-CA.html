If outsourced, the food business need to realize it has an equal role to play in pest control" with the pest management expert, says Dr. Siddiqi.</p>
<p>Pesticides are selected and applied in such a way that minimizes their possible harm to people, nontarget organisms, and the environment. IPM is probably to be misunderstood as pest management without chemicals which in truth requirement based usage of chemicals.

June 6, 2020 is World Pest Day, an annual observance to raise awareness about the crucial role that pest control specialists play in safeguarding health, food, property and the environment from pest risks around the globe.</p>
