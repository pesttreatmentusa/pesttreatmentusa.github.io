The chemical pest control and the natural pest control methods are the 2 main various kinds of pest control methods that are in need.</p>
<p>Biological control has been successfully used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To deal with intrusive pest problems, classical biological control approach is generally used where natural enemies from the native region of the intrusive pest are imported, multiplied, and released in the new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control strategy that has actually been efficiently used versus a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>

Standards and legislation regarding the use, permitted techniques of application and the storage conditions of chemicals and pesticides differ from nation to nation, typically being legislated by each state of area. Research and outreach are an essential part of the IPM design to recognize and prepare for pest issues, develop preventive and curative methods, and successfully distribute the info through standard and modern communication tools and techniques.</p>
