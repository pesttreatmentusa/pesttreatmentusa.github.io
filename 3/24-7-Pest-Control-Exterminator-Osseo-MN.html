Particular biostimulants based upon minerals, microorganisms, plant extracts, seaweed or algae impart caused systemic resistance to pests, diseases, and abiotic stress factors, but are applied as changes without any claims for pest or illness control (Larkin 2008, Vleesschauwer and Höfte 2009, Sharma et al. 2014, López-Bucio et al 2015, Dara 2018a ).
