<p>Correctly identify pests and beneficials on sticky cards and plants. The knowledge of numerous control choices, pest biology and damage capacity, and viability of offered resources makes it possible for the grower to decide appropriate for their circumstance. Greenhouses provide an ideal environment (e.g., temperature and light) for various biological control agents or natural opponents consisting of parasitoids, predators, and entomopathogenic nematodes.</p>
<p>The determination of the right reason for pest problem (understanding pest biology) and ecology is important in controling the environment to the crop's advantage and to the detriment of the pest.
