<p>Supply food and shelter for the helpful insects (e.g., flowering plants which offer nectar).

<p>Examples of cultural practices that motivate natural opponents and prevent pest perseverance consist of intercropping (multiple crops in the same field) to make it harder for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which attract pests away from harvest crops and which can later on be treated with select application of pesticides, and postponing planting times to accompany times where pests have emerged and died off for the season.</p>
