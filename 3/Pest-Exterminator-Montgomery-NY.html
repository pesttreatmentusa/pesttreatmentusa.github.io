Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a ecologically delicate and effective approach to pest management that counts on a mix of common-sense practices. IPM is an approach to ensure economic viability at both consumer and manufacturer level (seller is constantly anticipated to make a profit), ecological security through a balanced usage of all offered pest control options, and social reputation since IPM-based food is safe and budget friendly.</p>
