<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical methods such as cultural practices, usage of resistant ranges, proper irrigation and fertilization, and natural enemies. IPM considers the community as a whole and takes into consideration a well balanced mix of the previously mentioned control approaches to produce the most efficient and least damaging strategy.</p>
<p>Pesticide threats consist of intense, instant toxicity to people and other non-target organisms; long-lasting or persistent toxicity such as cancer; and ecological contamination of the air, or ground and surface water.
