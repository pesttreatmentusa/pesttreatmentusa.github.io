<p>Socio-psychological factors consisting of moral and reasonable considerations were found to the motorists in IPM execution in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A study of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka revealed that nearly 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications before pest or disease incident and just 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A survey conducted by Parsa et al. (2014) also revealed that a lack of certified IPM professionals and extension teachers was an impediment for IPM execution in industrialized countries.</p>
<p>We historically have sold nature short, both in its capability to reduce the effects of the efficiency of ecologically unsound techniques as well as its range of fundamental strengths that can be used to keep pest organisms within bounds.

<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a procedure that is used to control pest populations while reducing the influence on people and the surrounding environment.
