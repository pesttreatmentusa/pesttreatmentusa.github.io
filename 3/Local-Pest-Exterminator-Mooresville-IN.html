<p>We historically have sold nature short, both in its ability to neutralize the efficiency of environmentally unsound approaches as well as its variety of intrinsic strengths that can be used to keep pest organisms within bounds. For instance, strains of predaceous termites, rove beetles, lacewings, and species of parasitoids have actually been selected for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, consequently increasing the possibility that some will endure insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>
<p>If pesticides are required, they are chosen and used in such a way that prevents interfering with other IPM practices. Nearly every type of pest poses a threat to the properties they live in, whether it's a squirrel in the attic or termites under the floorboards. Beyond Pesticides supports the execution of an Ecological Pest Management (EPM) or strongly specified Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program in the indoor environment, and Organic Land Care (OLC) practices in the outside environment.</p>
