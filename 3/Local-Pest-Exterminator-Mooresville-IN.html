<p>We historically have sold nature short, both in its ability to neutralize the efficiency of environmentally unsound approaches as well as its variety of intrinsic strengths that can be used to keep pest organisms within bounds.

Nearly every type of pest poses a threat to the properties they live in, whether it's a squirrel in the attic or termites under the floorboards.
