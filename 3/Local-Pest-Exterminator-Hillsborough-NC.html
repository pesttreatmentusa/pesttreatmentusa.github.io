<p>Biological control has actually been successfully used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To address intrusive pest problems, classical biological control technique is typically utilized where natural opponents from the native area of the invasive pest are imported, multiplied, and launched in the brand-new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ).
