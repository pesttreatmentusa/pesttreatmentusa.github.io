<p>Damage of crop residue: Pupae of pest remains inside the crop residue and can be managed by destroying it. IPM is practiced to some degree in all agricultural crops, however artificial pesticides stay a dominant strategy in handling pests. Maybe you're the type to dive in, research your pest, explore the most reliable control choices, and are feeling well prepared to take things on on your own.</p>

<p>If pesticides are needed, they are selected and used in a manner that avoids interfering with other IPM practices. Practically every kind of pest poses a danger to the properties they populate, whether it's a squirrel in the attic or termites under the floorboards. Beyond Pesticides supports the implementation of an Ecological Pest Management (EPM) or highly defined Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program in the indoor environment, and Organic Land Care (OLC) practices in the outside environment.</p>
