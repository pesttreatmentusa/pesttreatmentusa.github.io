<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and reduce insect pest population through nonchemical techniques such as cultural practices, use of resistant varieties, proper watering and fertilization, and natural enemies. IPM considers the ecosystem as a whole and takes into account a balanced mix of the aforementioned control methods to produce the most reliable and least destructive strategy.</p>
<p>The number of plants inspected will depend upon elements such as the value of the crop, possible problems and size and kind of greenhouses. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) integrates various types of controls-- from hands-on pest removal to standard synthetic pesticides-- in a reasonable, long-term plan. Biopesticides are typically suitable with natural enemies, however there are exceptions.</p>
<p>The lots of varying hazards from pests make it a good idea for cultural heritage companies to establish an Integrated Preventive Pest Management program for their collections and structures. In these countries, regular usage of pesticides is limited to high value (money) crops and, as such, IPM adoption is mostly centered on cotton, sugarcane, soybean, and rice.</p>
<p>A comprehensive understanding of general IPM principles and various management options for all possible pest problems is necessary as some are preventive and others are curative. We usually advise pest control chemicals that do the job using the least amount of product. Broad spectrum pesticides (as a last option). These prevention and control methods consist of biological, mechanical, cultural, physical, hereditary, chemical, and regulatory methods.</p>
