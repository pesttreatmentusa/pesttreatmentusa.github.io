IPM includes utilizing the very best combination of cultural, biological and chemical steps for specific circumstances, consisting of plant biotechnology as suitable. This preparation consists of attention to field histories to expect what the pest issues may be, choosing crop varieties which are resistant or tolerant to pest damage, selecting tillage systems that will reduce expected pest damage while giving the crop the best yield capacity.</p>
