<p>Examples of cultural practices that motivate natural enemies and dissuade pest persistence consist of intercropping (several crops in the exact same field) to make it more difficult for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which draw in pests far from harvest crops and which can later be treated with select application of pesticides, and delaying planting times to accompany times where pests have emerged and passed away off for the season.</p>
<p>If pesticides are needed, they are selected and used in such a way that avoids disrupting other IPM practices. Nearly every type of pest poses a risk to the homes they populate, whether it's a squirrel in the attic or termites under the floorboards.
