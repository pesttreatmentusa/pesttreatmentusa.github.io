Integrated Pest Management or IPM, as it is typically understood, is a system of managing pests which is designed to be sustainable.</p>
<p>Organic food production is not pesticide-free and a few of the pesticides utilized in a natural system are as hazardous to humans and nontarget organisms as some chemical pesticides.
