<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical approaches such as cultural practices, use of resistant ranges, proper irrigation and fertilization, and natural enemies. IPM thinks about the community as a whole and takes into consideration a balanced mix of the aforementioned control methods to produce the most efficient and least harmful strategy.</p>
<p>The course will focus on the ecological and management principles of pest control and you will find out to evaluate the consequences of pesticide usage and application on the biological target.

We know how scary it can be to have even the slightest symptom of a bed bug infestation These pests can trigger skin inflammation and disrupt your life, and what's worse is they spread quickly and are hard to get rid of.

<p>This method of pest control has actually fallen out of favour in recent decades given that fire eliminates advantageous insects together with the pests and can have an unfavorable effect on the soil. To decrease potential damage to helpful insects, restrict your spraying to small areas where you can see pests lurking, and leave a couple of unsprayed "havens" for any excellent bugs you can't see.</p>
