<p>In referral to the concept of integrating the use of biological and other controls in complementary ways, the term was later broadened to welcome coordinated usage of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural enemies are inherently more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural opponents have actually been picked either naturally or through the efforts of scientists to possess higher levels of resistance.</p>
<p>If left to their own gadgets, pests can become a pricey issue for your business. If more tracking, identifications and action limits suggest that less risky controls are not working, then extra pest control approaches would be employed, such as targeted spraying of pesticides.
