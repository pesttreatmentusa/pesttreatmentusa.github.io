<p>For example, according to the United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS 2018 ), IPM is a sustainable, science-based, decision-making process that combines biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tools to identify, manage, and lower threat from pests and pest management tools and techniques in a way that lessens total economic, health, and ecological risks.</p>
<p>Tracking and identification lowers the risks of utilizing the incorrect kind of pesticide, or using pesticides when other methods will be more efficient. The advantage of the fogging pest control method is that it's thought about to be eco-friendly, it's odorless and doesn't leave any residues that are hard to be cleaned.
