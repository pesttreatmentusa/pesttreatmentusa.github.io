The majority of people normally consider pest control during the warmer months, when swarms of insects try to invade their lawns and homes, however, pests know no season. A green pest management IPM program utilizes pesticides stemmed from plants, such as botanicals, or other naturally occurring products.</p>
<p>Typically, the primary objective of IPM programmes is on agricultural insect pests (IPM Guidelines, 2009 ). Although, initially developed for agricultural pest management, IPM programs are now developed to include illness, weeds, and other pests that might hinder the management goals of websites such as residential and business structures, yard and grass locations, and house and community gardens.</p>
