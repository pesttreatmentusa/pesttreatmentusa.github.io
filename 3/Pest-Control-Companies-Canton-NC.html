<p>The four significant problems experienced with conventional pesticides are toxic residues, pest resistance, secondary pests, and pest resurgence (Lewis, 1997 ). Using natural pesticides and organophosphates that are more eco-friendly are encouraged and artificial pesticides ought to only be utilized as a last hope or just used as needed and often just at particular times in a pests life process.</p>
<p>The method to be selected for IPM depends on numerous elements, the crucial of which are nature of target pest, the environment, and financial aspect of the management. Insect pests cause considerable losses to food and fiber crops worldwide. If standard home health is neglected, the results of other types of pest control will be exceptionally short-lived as the pests will quickly be back, and in greater numbers.</p>
<p>Utilizing natural enemies as a curative control is less effective compared to applying them preventively. Employ appropriate scouting techniques and treatment decisions to preserve the beneficial insects that can provide additional bug pest control. Carefully keep an eye on fields for all pests to determine the requirement for remedial insecticide treatments. Now long term effective pest control is offered on your fingertips.</p>
<p>IPM programs work to keep track of for pests and identify them properly, so that appropriate control choices can be made in combination with action thresholds. Nevertheless, the major pattern has been toward the use of contemporary chemistry and molecular biology to change traditional pesticides with less dangerous chemicals or nontoxic biologically based items; however these ways are still therapies.</p>
