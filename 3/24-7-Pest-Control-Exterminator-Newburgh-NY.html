<p>Destruction of crop residue: Pupae of bug remains inside the crop residue and can be controlled by ruining it. IPM is practiced to some degree in all farming crops, however artificial pesticides stay a dominant strategy in handling pests. Perhaps you're the type to dive in, research study your pest, explore the most efficient control options, and are feeling well prepared to take things on by yourself.</p>
<p>The decision of the right cause of pest problem (understanding pest biology) and ecology is necessary in manipulating the environment to the crop's benefit and to the hinderance of the pest.
