<p>The approach to be selected for IPM depends on many factors, the important of which are nature of target pest, the environment, and economic element of the management. Insect pests trigger substantial losses to food and fiber crops worldwide. If basic home hygiene is neglected, the impacts of other kinds of pest control will be incredibly short-lived as the pests will quickly be back, and in greater numbers.</p>
<p>The success of control techniques need to be determined using signs based on tracking of hazardous organisms, beneficials, pesticide use, and effect on the environment. These include the renewal of pest populations after decimation of the natural opponents, advancement of insecticide-resistant populations, and unfavorable effect on nontarget organisms within and outside the crop system.</p>
