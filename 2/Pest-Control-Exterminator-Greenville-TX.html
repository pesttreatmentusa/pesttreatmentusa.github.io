<p>Diseases or pests can be present in a crop without causing economic damage. Accuracy applications of low toxicity pesticides instead of normal baseboard applications or treatment of a whole property also have actually proven to greatly reduce the total volumes of pesticides applied. Insect pests frequently have natural opponents that are useful to the landscape.</p>
<p>In addition to establishing clear indications that a pest control program is indeed an IPM system, it is also necessary to offer requirements to determine performance of the system. Generally between 30 minutes to 2 hours is needed to perform the general pest control treatment. Public need is affected by retail marketing methods, issues for food security based on pesticide guidelines in their region, and an absence of knowledge on food production among other elements.</p>
