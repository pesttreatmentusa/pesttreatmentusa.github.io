<p>Pests or diseases can be present in a crop without causing economic damage. Accuracy applications of low toxicity pesticides rather than normal baseboard applications or treatment of a whole property also have proven to greatly minimize the overall volumes of pesticides used. Insect pests often have natural opponents that are beneficial to the landscape.</p>
<p>In recommendation to the principle of integrating using biological and other controls in complementary methods, the term was later broadened to welcome coordinated use of all biological, cultural, and synthetic practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural enemies are inherently more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural opponents have actually been selected either naturally or through the efforts of researchers to have higher levels of resistance.</p>
<p>Biological control has been successfully utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To address invasive pest problems, classical biological control method is normally used where natural opponents from the native area of the intrusive pest are imported, multiplied, and released in the new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control method that has been efficiently used against a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
