This combination of IGRs can be reliable in avoiding re-infestation of pests such as cockroaches. SWPM is susceptible to attack by wood boring insects which, in a collection environment, may trigger severe damage to structures, office furniture, artifacts and specimens. Applicators carry out more intricate tasks, are able to utilize a broader range of pesticides, and might focus on a specific location of pest control.</p>
<p>Their expert exterminators are readily available for 24 hours of emergency services for their important clients.
