This combination of IGRs can be reliable in avoiding re-infestation of pests such as cockroaches. SWPM is susceptible to attack by wood boring insects which, in a collection environment, may trigger severe damage to structures, office furniture, artifacts and specimens. Applicators carry out more intricate tasks, are able to utilize a broader range of pesticides, and might focus on a specific location of pest control.</p>
<p>Their expert exterminators are readily available for 24 hours of emergency services for their important clients.

Under this scheme, pest control was "monitored" by qualified entomologists, and insecticide applications were based upon conclusions reached from routine tracking of pest and natural-enemy populations.</p>
