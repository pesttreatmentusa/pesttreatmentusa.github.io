<p>The success of control techniques should be measured using indicators based on tracking of damaging organisms, beneficials, pesticide usage, and impact on the environment. These include the renewal of pest populations after decimation of the natural opponents, development of insecticide-resistant populations, and negative influence on nontarget organisms within and outside the crop system.</p>
<p>Integrated Pest management (IPM) as specified by Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) indicates a pest management system in the context of associated environment and population dynamics of the pests species using all suitable method and approaches in as compatible way as possible and maintaining pest population at levels below causing unaccepted damage or loss.</p>
<p>Utilizing information about pests' biology and routines, in addition to a toolbox of pest management methods, pest control employees locate, recognize, and eliminate pests.
