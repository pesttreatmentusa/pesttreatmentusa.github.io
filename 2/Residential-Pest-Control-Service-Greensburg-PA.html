<p>The 4 major problems come across with conventional pesticides are toxic residues, pest resistance, secondary pests, and pest revival (Lewis, 1997 ). Making use of natural pesticides and organophosphates that are more eco-friendly are artificial and encouraged pesticides must only be used as a last option or only utilized as required and often just at particular times in a pests life process.</p>
<p>IPM methods include both chemical and nonchemical methods to avoid and control pest populations from reaching economically destructive levels. In IPM, pesticides are used at the tiniest effective dosage when other techniques of pest control have stopped working. IPM is an ecosystem-based method that focuses on long-term prevention of pests or their damage through a combination of strategies such as biological control, habitat control, adjustment of cultural practices, and use of resistant ranges.</p>
<p>If pesticides are required, they are picked and used in such a way that avoids interrupting other IPM practices. Practically every type of pest presents a threat to the residential or commercial properties they inhabit, whether it's a squirrel in the attic or termites under the floorboards. Beyond Pesticides supports the application of an Ecological Pest Management (EPM) or highly specified Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program in the indoor environment, and Organic Land Care (OLC) practices in the outdoor environment.</p>
