After finishing the needed training, employees can provide supervised pest control services. The use of physical barriers such as row covers or trenches prevents insects from reaching the crop.</p>
<p>Making certain that collection areas are kept clean and complimentary of trash, particles and foods items that might encourage pests. The pesticides used will be as particular as possible for the target and will have the least adverse effects on human health, non-target organisms and the environment.
