<p>Cover or eliminate bird cages and aquarium, and move other family pets before using aerosol (spray) pesticides. Make certain the individual who will be applying your pesticides holds a legitimate image ID Pest Control Licence.

It's possible that the duplicated usage of pesticides may be more hazardous in the long term than the pests themselves.
