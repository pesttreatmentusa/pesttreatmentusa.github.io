<p>As part of the Sustainable Usage Regulation on Pesticides, professional users of pesticides are required to think about the principles of IPM before the use of chemicals. Biological pest control is a method of managing pests such as insects and termites by utilizing other organisms 8 It counts on predation, parasitism, herbivory or other natural systems, however typically also involves an active human management role.</p>
<p>Termites eat furniture, papers, books, and even documents kept in safes and lockers, thus triggering enormous damage within simply a couple of months. This stops the pest gaining resistance to chemicals produced by the plant or applied to the crops. Exterminators go to customer houses and businesses to check for insects or rodents. Classical biological control includes introducing natural opponents from a pest's native variety into a new location where native natural opponents do not supply control.</p>
