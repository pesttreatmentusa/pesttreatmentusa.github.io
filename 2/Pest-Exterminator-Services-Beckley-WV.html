<p>Concurrently, it is also based on semiochemicals particularly kairomones and allomones 35 The pests are pushed back or deterred far from a plant (push) through allomones that can be repellents or deterrents and are concurrently brought in (pull) by kairomones to trap crops where they can be eliminated or eliminated 35 (Figure 5 ).

<h3>The Importance of Hiring the Right Commercial Pest Control Beckley WV</h3>
<p>The scientific basis of "Integrated Pest Control" evolved over a period of about ten years, generally among researchers at the University of California, Berkeley and Riverside campuses. Crops are frequently monocultures, including a single crop species, which creates a homogenous habitat typically lacking key requirements of natural enemies, therefore preferring pest species.</p>
<p>Termites are such devastating pests that you want your termite treatment to lead to termite extermination. Once monitoring, action, and identification limits suggest that pest control is needed, and preventive methods are no longer effective or available, IPM programs then assess the correct control method both for effectiveness and risk. The letter of invite for this plenary address suggested for its title the central theme of the entire Congress, i.e., the affirmative sentence: "Integrated Pest Management: A Global Reality".</p>
