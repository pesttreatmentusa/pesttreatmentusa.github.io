<p>The habits of the pest can be made use of for its monitoring and control through baits, traps, and mating disturbance techniques (Heinz et al. 1992, Shorey and Gerber 1996, Foster and Harris 1997, Vladés et al. 2005, El-Sayed et al. 2009, Morrison et al. 2016 ). Baits including harmful material will draw in and kill the pests when distributed in the field or put in traps.</p>
<p>In referral to the idea of incorporating the use of other and biological controls in complementary ways, the term was later on expanded to embrace collaborated usage of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural opponents are inherently more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural enemies have been chosen either naturally or through the efforts of scientists to have greater levels of resistance.</p>
