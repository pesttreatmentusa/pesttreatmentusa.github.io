<p>The four significant issues come across with standard pesticides are toxic residues, pest resistance, secondary pests, and pest renewal (Lewis, 1997 ). The use of natural pesticides and organophosphates that are more eco-friendly are encouraged and synthetic pesticides should only be utilized as a last option or just utilized as required and typically just at particular times in a pests life process.</p>
