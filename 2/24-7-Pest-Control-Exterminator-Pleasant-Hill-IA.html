<p>IPM is utilized in farming, gardening, forestry, human habitations, preventive preservation and general pest control, including structural pest management, grass pest management and decorative pest management. Treat a pest infestation with a hand sprayer, fertilize your grass with a granular spreader, deal with termite treatments with a foamer, bait for roaches and ants with an expert bait weapon, or use pre-emergent herbicides with a knapsack sprayer.</p>
