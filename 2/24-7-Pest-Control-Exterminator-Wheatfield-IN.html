<p>IPM approaches include both chemical and nonchemical ways to prevent and control pest populations from reaching financially harmful levels. In IPM, pesticides are used at the tiniest effective dose when other approaches of pest control have actually failed. IPM is an ecosystem-based strategy that concentrates on long-lasting prevention of pests or their damage through a mix of techniques such as biological control, habitat adjustment, modification of cultural practices, and use of resistant varieties.</p>
<p>Biological control has actually been effectively used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To deal with intrusive pest concerns, classical biological control method is normally used where natural enemies from the native area of the intrusive pest are imported, increased, and released in the brand-new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control technique that has actually been efficiently used against a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
