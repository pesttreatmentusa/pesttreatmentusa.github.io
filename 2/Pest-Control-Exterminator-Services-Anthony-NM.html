<p>4 ). With its success in lots of parts of the world, IPM is deemed a ecologically benign and economical  pest control strategy preferably suited for both small and large farmers worldwide. When termites have entered a structure, they do not restrict themselves to wood; they also damage paper, fabric, carpets and more. In some ways, IPM can be viewed as a decision-making procedure in which observations (from evaluation and tracking) are used to make pest control choices based on pre-determined management objectives.</p>
<p>Farmers and growers have been routinely using many of these IPM techniques for decades or perhaps generations - strategies such as crop rotation, not planting crops in areas vulnerable to pests, or using tolerant or resistant varieties.
