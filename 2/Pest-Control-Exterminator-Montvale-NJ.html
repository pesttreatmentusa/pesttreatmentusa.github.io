<p>If pesticides are required, they are picked and applied in a way that prevents interfering with other IPM practices. Practically every kind of pest presents a danger to the homes they live in, whether it's a squirrel in the attic or termites under the floorboards. Beyond Pesticides supports the implementation of an Ecological Pest Management (EPM) or highly specified Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program in the indoor environment, and Organic Land Care (OLC) practices in the outdoor environment.</p>
