<p>Socio-psychological elements consisting of moral and reasonable considerations were discovered to the drivers in IPM implementation in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A survey of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka showed that nearly 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications prior to pest or disease incident and just 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A study carried out by Parsa et al. (2014) likewise showed that an absence of certified IPM professionals and extension teachers was an impediment for IPM application in developed nations.</p>
