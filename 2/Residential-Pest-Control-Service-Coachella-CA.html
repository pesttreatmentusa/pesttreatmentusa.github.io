A single spotting of any pest in a storage facility during an audit can mean a great deal of damage to the company-financial and reputation-wise. All setting off a bug bomb" does is cover your possessions with poisonous chemicals, damage the air quality in your home or business, possibly contaminate food and other perishables, and just eliminates pests at the surface area of the problem.</p>
<p>Without controls on population development, organisms can rapidly accomplish levels at which damage is caused hence becoming pests (e.g., locust swarms stripping landscapes bare). For example, a rich area likely will have a lot of big, costly homes, so pest control costs could be higher there since there's more territory for a pest control company to cover in one of those homes.</p>
