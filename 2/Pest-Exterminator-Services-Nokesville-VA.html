<p>Their expert exterminators are readily available for 24 hr of emergency services for their important clients. However, the high capacity for recreation of insect pests remains, and a population explosion of many types can be expected from a low-density level whenever ideal ecological conditions occur or control slackens. Under this scheme, bug control was "monitored" by certified entomologists, and insecticide applications were based upon conclusions reached from periodic monitoring of pest and natural-enemy populations.</p>
<p>We historically have sold nature short, both in its ability to neutralize the efficiency of environmentally unsound methods in addition to its variety of fundamental strengths that can be used to keep pest organisms within bounds. For example, pressures of predaceous mites, rove beetles, lacewings, and species of parasitoids have been chosen for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, thus increasing the possibility that some will survive insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>
