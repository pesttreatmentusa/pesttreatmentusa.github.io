<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program is a environmentally delicate and efficient method to pest control. These might or might not consist of products listed on the Organic Materials Review Institute (OMRI) 15 Although the pesticides and especially insecticides used in natural farming and organic gardening are normally safer than synthetic pesticides, they are not always more environmentally friendly or safe than artificial pesticides and can trigger harm.</p>
<p>IPM techniques include both chemical and nonchemical means to prevent and control pest populations from reaching financially damaging levels. In IPM, pesticides are used at the smallest reliable dose when other techniques of pest control have failed.
