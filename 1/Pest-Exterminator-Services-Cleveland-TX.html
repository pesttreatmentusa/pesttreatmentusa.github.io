Pests seek out places with an abundant food source, as well as a safe environment in which they can breed. Other reasonably low-risk pesticides are readily available for some pests. Inoculative biological control suggests releasing natural enemies regularly or seasonally to reestablish a balance that has not been preserved naturally or has been interrupted by other control techniques.</p>
