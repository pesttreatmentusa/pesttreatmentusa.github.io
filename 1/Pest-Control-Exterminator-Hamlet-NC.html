<p>Biological control has actually been effectively utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To attend to intrusive pest problems, classical biological control approach is normally used where natural enemies from the native area of the intrusive pest are imported, increased, and released in the brand-new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control method that has been successfully used versus a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
