	<meta name="description" content="Mosquito Pest Control in Camdenton MO - Our effective use of gel baits as a single monitoring-guided intervention, independent of other IPM tactics (e.g., caulking, sanitation, cleaning, trapping), is consistent with an emergent body of literature showing that proper use of baits constitutes the most cost-effective intervention to mitigate the harmful effects of cockroaches and their allergens reviews: 2, 7. While more comprehensive IPM approaches e.g. 34 , 35 , 36 may secure faster and more effective cockroach reductions, the additional costs associated with materials, labor, and administrative matters can make them less practical in many real-world situations.">
