<p>In referral to the idea of incorporating making use of biological and other controls in complementary methods, the term was later broadened to accept collaborated usage of all biological, cultural, and synthetic practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962).

<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic methods to control household pest pests. Many anti-pesticide NGOs have a much more simplified meaning of IPM - they see IPM as being nearly exclusively about minimizing pesticide usage. If all other integrated pest management tactics are unable to keep an insect pest population listed below an economic threshold, then use of an insecticide to control the pest and avoid financial loss is justified.</p>
