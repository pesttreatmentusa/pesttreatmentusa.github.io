Numerous anti-pesticide NGOs have a a lot more simplified definition of IPM - they see IPM as being practically exclusively about reducing pesticide use. If all other integrated pest management tactics are not able to keep an insect pest population listed below a financial threshold, then use of an insecticide to control the pest and avoid economic loss is warranted.</p>
<p>If, after following preventive and organized management practices (# 1, 2, 3, and 4), pests are above limit levels and beneficials populations are low, release beneficials or apply chosen biopesticides with low ecological effect. Professional exterminators use various types of pesticides and baits to eliminate and get rid of pests.
