<p>A redirection of pest management is needed to incorporate year-round soil, weed, cropping, water, and associated practices at farm and community levels and to think about the results of these practices on the general fauna, nutritional state, and balance of local ecosystems (16 ). Integrated pest management (IPM) is a term used to describe a methodical method of managing pests using non-chemical pest management approaches and the sensible usage of pesticides when pest populations surpass acceptable levels.</p>
