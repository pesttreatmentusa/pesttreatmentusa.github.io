Insect pests cause considerable losses to food and fiber crops worldwide.

<p>This info, in mix with offered pest control techniques, is used to manage pest damage by the most economical means, and with the minimal threat to people, property, and the environment. Applications of pesticides are constantly the last hope in an IPM program. This is gone over in Chapter 16. Changes in cultural, agricultural, and economic patterns throughout the world have had a profound effect on insect-pest management and control.</p>
<p>On the other hand, organic food production uses a number of the exact same concepts as IPM but restricts the use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, rather than artificial chemicals. Other claims consist of reductions in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into several crops to reduce the requirement for other, less ecologically favorable, herbicides.</p>
