Other claims consist of decreases in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into a number of crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into numerous crops to minimize the need for other, less environmentally beneficial, herbicides.</p>
