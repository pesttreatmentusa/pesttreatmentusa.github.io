<p>The decision of the appropriate cause of pest issue (understanding pest biology) and ecology is essential in controling the environment to the crop's benefit and to the hinderance of the pest.

<p>You just need to spend an hour on the internet to be overwhelmed by global problems: the vicious cycle that occurs from making use of large amounts of artificial fertilizer, which increases dependence on pesticides, which in turn causes resistance and damage of the environment and human health - while in fifty years' time the world's stocks of the most crucial component of synthetic fertilizer, phosphate, will almost have actually gone out.</p>
