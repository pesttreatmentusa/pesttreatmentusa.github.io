Here, insecticides will only be used when they are financially possible and it appears that natural opponents will not control the pests. Crop rotation: Monocultures offer prospective cotton pests with plentiful food sources, triggering their populations to increase rapidly.</p>
<p>In referral to the idea of incorporating making use of biological and other controls in complementary ways, the term was later on expanded to embrace collaborated use of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural opponents are inherently more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural opponents have actually been chosen either naturally or through the efforts of researchers to possess higher levels of resistance.</p>
<p>Termites consume furniture, papers, books, and even files kept in safes and lockers, hence triggering colossal damage within simply a few months.
