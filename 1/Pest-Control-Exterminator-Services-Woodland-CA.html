<p>In recommendation to the principle of integrating the use of biological and other controls in complementary methods, the term was later broadened to welcome coordinated usage of all biological, cultural, and synthetic practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural enemies are inherently more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural opponents have been chosen either naturally or through the efforts of scientists to have higher levels of resistance.</p>

Ants reside in the smallest of the cracks and are typically discovered inside the walls, cabinets, corners of the wall, and so on Intelligent resistance management will be a key for sustainable use of GM crops in IPM while there is a requirement for much better harmonization of GM crops with existing IPM methods.</p>
