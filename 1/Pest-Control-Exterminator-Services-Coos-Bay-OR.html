A study of veggie growers in Sri Lanka showed that almost 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications prior to pest or disease event and only 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A survey performed by Parsa et al. (2014) also showed that a lack of qualified IPM experts and extension educators was an impediment for IPM implementation in developed nations.</p>

Versatility and Time- The procedure of pest control takes some time and efforts. Pests are unwanted plants, animals, insects, germs or other organisms that hinder human activity.</p>
<p>Pesticides are selected and used in a manner that lessens their possible harm to people, nontarget organisms, and the environment. IPM is more than likely to be misinterpreted as pest management without chemicals which in truth need based usage of chemicals. Pests can be brought into the food processing facility through the supply chain, in the active ingredients or packaging, and the center itself will attract pests through food smells and lighting.</p>
