<p>Subterranean termites are the most damaging termites in the United States. Diseases or pests can be present in a crop without triggering financial damage. Precision applications of low toxicity pesticides instead of normal baseboard applications or treatment of an entire property also have actually proven to greatly lower the overall volumes of pesticides used. Insect pests often have natural enemies that are useful to the landscape.</p>
