<p>The expert user needs to keep the use of pesticides and other kinds of intervention to levels that are required, e.g. by decreased dosages, reduced application frequency or partial applications, considering that the level of threat in vegetation is appropriate and they do not increase the threat for advancement of resistance in populations of harmful organisms.</p>
<p>If, after following organized and preventive management practices (# 1, 2, 3, and 4), pests are above threshold levels and beneficials populations are low, release beneficials or apply chosen biopesticides with low ecological impact. Professional exterminators utilize different kinds of pesticides and baits to kill and get rid of pests. Effective, permanent corrective actions can then be taken to prevent pests from getting in the structure and infesting the structure and collections.</p>
