<p>The very first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and reduce insect pest population through nonchemical techniques such as cultural practices, usage of resistant varieties, proper irrigation and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM thinks about the environment as a whole and considers a balanced mix of the aforementioned control approaches to produce the most efficient and least harmful strategy.</p>
<p>The decision of the correct reason for pest issue (understanding pest biology) and ecology is essential in manipulating the environment to the crop's benefit and to the hinderance of the pest. Insecticides hazardous to most insects (broad-spectrum) will more negatively affect natural opponents than materials that are selective or narrow-spectrum for particular insect species or life stages.</p>
<p>You just need to invest an hour on the web to be overwhelmed by international issues: the vicious cycle that occurs from the use of large amounts of artificial fertilizer, which increases dependence on pesticides, which in turn triggers resistance and damage of the environment and human health - while in fifty years' time the world's stocks of the most essential element of synthetic fertilizer, phosphate, will practically have actually gone out.</p>
<p>Other methods consist of hand selecting of pests, sticky boards or tapes for control of flying insects in greenhouses and different trapping techniques. IPM makes the most of all appropriate pest management options consisting of, but not limited to, the judicious usage of pesticides. Our home pest control services are designed to secure you year-round from annoyance trespassers such as ants, cockroaches, spiders and other household pests for Greater Houston-Galveston homeowners.</p>
