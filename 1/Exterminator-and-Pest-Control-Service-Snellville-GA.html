Utilizing entomopathogenic germs, fungi, microsporidia, nematodes, or viruses, and fermentation byproducts of some microbes against arthropod pests, plant parasitic nematodes, and plant pathogens usually come under microbial control (Mankau 1981, Paulitz and Bélanger 2001, Dong and Zhang 2006, Lacey 2017 ).</p>
<p>Insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and other pest control and lawn care items are most effective when they are used properly.

A resistant variety might be less preferred by the insect pest, negatively affect its typical advancement and survival, or the plant might tolerate the damage without an economic loss in yield or quality.</p>
