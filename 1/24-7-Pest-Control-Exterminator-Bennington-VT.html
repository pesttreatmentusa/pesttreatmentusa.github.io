<p>Fall is back, and winter is near; thank goodness!. Damage of crop residue: Pupae of insect remains inside the crop residue and can be controlled by damaging it. IPM is practiced to some degree in all farming crops, but synthetic pesticides remain a dominant method in handling pests. Perhaps you're the type to dive in, research your pest, explore the most reliable control alternatives, and are feeling well prepared to take things on by yourself.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that motivate natural enemies and prevent pest persistence include intercropping (numerous crops in the same field) to make it more difficult for pests to discover a host plant, planting trap crops which bring in pests far from harvest crops and which can later on be treated with choose application of pesticides, and delaying planting times to accompany times where pests have emerged and passed away off for the season.</p>
