<p>There are two different types of pest control services. Cultural controls are practices that lower pest facility, survival, dispersal, and reproduction. Growers in Bangladesh, Haiti, Moldova, and Myanmar, throughout training programs organized by the U.S. Company for International Advancement, shared that natural farming is more tough than traditional farming specifically for pest management, however they produce organically since of high returns (personal communication).</p>
<p>Tighter guidelines for food security, occupational health and safety, and the environment imply in-house pest control isn't an option for lots of food companies these days. Farmers are faced with myriad of production challenges where the most common problems are pests, which include weeds, illness, and insects. Likewise, pest and crop management disciplines need to collaborate to develop control recommendations that show these interactions.</p>

Established in 1967, it is the leading association of the expert pest management industries, with over 350 members throughout the nation.</p>
